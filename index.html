    Birds our chirping feathered friends who have amazed us by their
    aerodynamics and exotic colours are under great threat
    there are 9934 species of birds that are existing in the world
    today out of which staggering 1300 (13%)
    are threatened under extension House Sparrow is one of them

    Sparrows, thought tiny are very sensitive and strongly immune
    birds and their sudden disappearance as sentence or as
    ecological indicators is a warning to humans about impending
    environmental hazards

    The excessive use of mosquito repellents
<P align= left<font size= "3"face= "Times new roman" color= "red">
